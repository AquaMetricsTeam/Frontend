# Overview

The Aqua Metrics platform uses **JWT Authentication** with **Refresh Token Rotation**.

After a successful login:

- An **Access Token (JWT)** is returned.
- A **Refresh Token** is returned.
- The Access Token is used to authorize API requests.
- The Refresh Token is used to obtain a new Access Token when the current one expires.

## Possible Responses

| Status Code | Description               |
| ----------- | ------------------------- |
| 200         | Login successful          |
| 401         | Invalid email or password |
| 403         | Account is inactive       |
| 400         | Validation failed         |

---

# Using the Access Token

Every protected endpoint requires the Access Token.

Add the following header:

```
Authorization: Bearer {accessToken}
```

Example

```
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGc...
```

---

# Refresh Token

Obtains a new Access Token without requiring the user to log in again.

The previous Refresh Token becomes invalid immediately after use.

This implementation follows **Refresh Token Rotation**.

---

## Endpoint

```
POST http://aquametrics.runasp.net/api/Auth/refresh
```

---

## Request

```json
{
  "refreshToken": "4A2D87A4E53D4F5A..."
}
```

---

## Successful Response (200 OK)

```json


{
  "success": true,
  "message": "User information retrieved successfully.",
  "data": {
    "accessToken": "eyJhbGc...",
    "refreshToken": "6F8A98D7EAA2F44...",
    "expiration": "2026-07-22T17:50:00Z",
    "userId": "ec20c6a9-4554-4060-736d-08dee7622e59",
    "fullName": "System Administrator",
    "email": "admin@aqua.com",
    "roles": ["Admin"]
  }
}

## Important

After a successful refresh:

- The old Refresh Token is revoked.
- The old Refresh Token cannot be used again.
- Always replace the stored Refresh Token with the newly returned one.

## Possible Responses

| Status Code | Description                  |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| 200         | Token refreshed successfully |

# Logout

Logs the user out by revoking the current Refresh Token.

# Authentication Flow

```
Login
    │
    ▼
Receive Access Token + Refresh Token
    │
    ▼
Use Access Token in Authorization Header
    │
    ▼
Access Token Expires
    │
    ▼
Call /refresh
    │
    ▼
Receive New Access Token + New Refresh Token
    │
    ▼
Replace Stored Tokens
```

---

# Security Notes

- Access Tokens are JWTs.
- Refresh Tokens are stored securely on the server.
- Refresh Tokens are single-use.
- Refresh Token Rotation is implemented.
- Only active accounts may authenticate.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is enforced using JWT Role Claims.

---

# Frontend & Mobile Responsibilities

The client application must:

- Store the Access Token securely.
- Store the latest Refresh Token securely.
- Include the Access Token in the Authorization header.
- Automatically call `/refresh` when the Access Token expires.
- Replace both stored tokens after every successful refresh.
- Call `/logout` before signing the user out.
