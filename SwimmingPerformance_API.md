# Swimming Performance API

## Overview

The Swimming Performance API is used by authenticated users to record, review, update, and manage swimming-specific performance data linked to a training record.

A swimming performance represents a swimming drill/set and captures:

- Stroke or drill type
- Distance
- Repetitions
- Rest interval
- Best, average, and worst repetition times
- Technique evaluation
- Start evaluation
- Turn evaluation
- Finish evaluation
- Pace consistency
- RPE
- Performance status
- Coach comment

## PerformanceGrade

The swimming performance uses `PerformanceGrade` for technical evaluations such as technique, starts, turns, finishes, and pace consistency.

> The exact enum values are not included here because the provided implementation does not include the `PerformanceGrade` enum definition. Add its values to this section once the enum is finalized.

# Swimming Performance Flow

The recommended flow is:

```text
Training Plan
      ↓
Training Session
      ↓
Athlete Attendance
      ↓
Training Record
      ↓
Swimming Performance
      ↓
Swimming Drill / Set Data
      ↓
Coach Review
      ↓
Athlete Performance History
```

A swimming performance is linked to a `TrainingRecord`.

The `TrainingRecord` represents the athlete's overall session performance, while `SwimmingPerformance` represents the swimming-specific details performed during that session.

### Example

```text
Training Record
│
├── Performance Rating: 9
├── Fatigue Level: 5
├── Session Completed: true
├── Injury Occurred: false
│
└── Swimming Performances
    │
    ├── 100m Freestyle × 4
    │   ├── Best: 1:08
    │   ├── Average: 1:10
    │   ├── Worst: 1:13
    │   ├── Technique: Good
    │   └── Turns: Good
    │
    └── 50m Kick × 8
        ├── Best: 0:42
        ├── Average: 0:44
        └── Pace Consistency: Good
```

# Important Notes

- `BestRepTime`, `AverageRepTime`, and `WorstRepTime` describe repetition/lap-level timing for the recorded swimming drill.
- `Turns`, `Start`, `Finish`, `Technique`, and `PaceConsistency` capture swimming-specific technical information that is not represented by the generic training record.
- `RPE` means **Rate of Perceived Exertion** and represents how difficult the effort was perceived to be.
- Multiple swimming performances can be created for one training record through `CreateSwimmingPerformanceRequest`.
- `GetByTrainingRecord` returns all swimming performances belonging to the selected training record.
- Swimming performances support filtering by athlete, training session, stroke, and status.
- Archive/restore is used instead of permanent deletion.
